# 🏴‍☠️ OverTheWire Bandit - Linux CLI Journey

Welcome to my repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey in the **First Front** of my training plan, aimed at deeply understanding Linux system architecture, mastering the Command Line Interface (CLI), and networking, in preparation for advanced CTFs and System Hacking.

## 🎯 Objectives:
1. Solve and document **OverTheWire: Bandit** challenges step-by-step.
2. Understand the mechanics of commands and security concepts behind each level, not just getting the flag.
3. Build a solid foundation for handling Linux servers via CLI like a pro.

## 🛡️ Post-Mortem Analysis:
Through 34 tiers of simulated environments, I successfully bypassed restricted user spaces, cracked cryptographic encodings, audited forensic logging structures, and leveraged subtle architectural flaws to escalate privileges from a zero-access container up to system completion.

## 📈 Next Deployment Grid
Now that the Linux CLI & System Architecture fortress is fully secured, I am pivoting my offensive security framework toward:

- **The Second Front (Python Automation):** Forging custom security tooling, network scanners, and automation scripts using Python.
- **The Third Front (System Hacking):** Active Directory breaching, Service-Side exploitation, and Privilege Escalation (TryHackMe & VulnHub).
- **The Fourth Front (Binary Exploitation):** Low-Level Security, Reverse Engineering, and Memory Corruption (pwn.college & Advanced CTFs).

"Never trust the environment; always audit the infrastructure."
